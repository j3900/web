 <p>I am thinking we can use this page as a page for the owner to edit the blog, with a box for posting content and also maybe a couple of layout color changing options and logo icon change option. It won't have to look like the rest of the site and we can just use one of those "Authentication Required" pop up boxes for them to log in. </p>
