Mission Statement:
	This is just a design of a blog for other people or ourselves to potentially use, so it is currently filled with nonsense.

Major Design Points:
	The site design consists of a consistent layout through all pages, with a purple navigation bar to the left with a few links and a logo, then the rest of the page is a scrollable area that has white rounded boxes filled with content that are surrounded by gray space.

Required Elements:
	Style sheet:
		Our site contains a single style sheet that uses all kinds of selectors. Most importantly, the nav and list within’s selectors, which style the navigation bar, the text-post and image-post classes which style text posts and image posts differently, for example, they have different borders.

	Navigation:
		Our site uses a left hand sidebar navigation, with links to Home and 		Feedback pages. The pencil in the navigation bar also serves as a link to the home 	page.
	
	Structured layout:
		Our layout is the same for every page: a purple side navigation bar on the left and white blocks of content in the main area which is a light gray. The larger content area scrolls while the navigation stays put.

	JavaScript:
		We intend to use JavaScript in our Feedback page in order for the user to 	send us feedback by email easily
	
	Images:
		This site will use lots of images as filler for our “posts”. Right now there is just one cat. Another image we use is the pencil that serves as a logo for the site. Bothe images obtained from http://www.freestockphotos.biz/
